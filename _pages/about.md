I’m a research engineer with a background in electrical engineering and a passion for creating at the interaction of hardware and software. I started my journey a bit earlier than most, beginning college at 15 and completing a PhD at 23, experiences that shaped both my curiosity and the way I approach learning.

I’m interested in how engineered systems can enhance human experience, whether through robotics, imaging, or entirely new interfaces. I thrive in spaces where exploration meets precision, and where learning never really stops.

Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with projects that let me tinker, prototype, and build for the sake of curiosity. What motivates me most is the idea that even small, thoughtful innovations can ripple outward and make a meaningful difference.
